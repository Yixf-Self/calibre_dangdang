Calibre Metadata Source Plugin for dangdang.com
=========

This plugin allows Calibre to read book information from dangdang.com when you choose to download/fetch metadata. Calibre currently comes with plugins for a number of information sources such as Amazon and Googlebooks. Adding this plugin can potentially increase both the success rate and quality of information retrieved for some of your Chinese books.

### Main Features of v0.0.1
This plugin can retrieve dangdang id, title, author, comments, rating, publisher, publication date, language, tags and covers from dangdang.com. The dangdang id will also be displayed in the book details panel as "dangdang.com" to be clicked on and taken directly to the website for that book.

### Special Notes:
* Requires Calibre 0.8 or later.
* No ISBN information for kindle books can be retrieved from dangdang.com since almost all chinese kindle books have no ISBN information.

### Installation Notes:
Download the zip file and install the plugin as described in the Introduction to plugins thread.
Note that this is not a GUI plugin so it is not intended/cannot be added to context menus/toolbars etc.

### Version History:
* __Version 0.1.0__ - 30 Oct 2016
    Initial release of plugin.
